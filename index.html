            <h3>Something to think about!</h3>
            <p>Being an Airbnb host is a very easy way to make money.  Even if it's not something you see yourself doing full time.   </p>

            <h2>Sharing is Caring</h2>
            <h3>Sharing your Space</h3>
            <p>Being a host doesnt necessarly mean you need to buy an extra home or an apartment.  You can share your space that you live in if you have an extra room just collecting dust.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extra Money</li>
                <li>Meet People</li>
                <li>Refer people to become hosts and collect bonus</li>
                
            </ul>
            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Oscar and I am 35 years old.  I love playing games and sports.  I'm also into working out at the gym.  I work a full time job away from home.  I became an Airbnb host last year and it has been amazing.  I've met quite
of few people and also have made some great extra money.  </p>
